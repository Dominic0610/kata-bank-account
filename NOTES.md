# NOTES: Quick thoughts about the kata implementation
## Which dependencies ?
There are 3 user stories in the kata. We clearly need a BDD testing framework:
- jbehave https://jbehave.org/
- Cucumber https://cucumber.io/
- Cucumber-JVM https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/java/
- Other?

Having some experience with the first one, I'll pick it. May try the others later. New Git branch: *jbehave*.\
Add other useful but minimal dependencies like *Lombok*.\
No persistence, minimal implementation => forget about *Spring* for now.

##Domain
All right. We have our jbehave framework, and we can see it works: `mvn integration-test`.\
Our stories are just narratives for now. If we want frequent pushes and avoid pushing failing tests,
we don't want to write scenarios and the BDD test classes right away: there would be too much code for the next push.\
So just focus on the domain objects, and commit them one by one along their JUnit tests.

- ###Amount
A simple wrapper for a BigDecimal.

This might be a major drawback with non-decimal currencies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-decimal_currency.
What about 1 Galleon = 17 Sickles = 493 Knuts in Harry Potter?\

The good news is that this special case is rare in real-world:
only Mauritania and Madagascar still have non-decimal currencies -
